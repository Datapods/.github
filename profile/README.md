### We're putting control over your data back where it belongs - with you.

Datapods' mission is to empower individuals by giving them control and ownership over their personal data, transforming it from a commodity exploited by big tech into a valuable asset that users can manage, understand, and share on their terms. We're building a future where data privacy and personal agency aren't just ideals but practical realities for everyone.
